## Charts

## Key Metrics
Here are the key metrics visualized in these charts:
1. **Acceptance Rate:** This metric represents the ratio of accepted lines to the total lines suggested by GitHub Copilot. This rate is an indicator of the relevance and usefulness of Copilot's suggestions.

## Setup instructions

In the `.env` file, you can configure several environment variables that control the behavior of the application.

#### VUE_APP_SCOPE 

The `VUE_APP_SCOPE` environment variable in the `.env` file determines the scope of the API calls made by the application. It can be set to either 'enterprise' or 'organization'.

- If set to 'enterprise', the application will target API calls to the GitHub Enterprise account defined in the `VUE_APP_GITHUB_ENT` variable.
- If set to 'organization', the application will target API calls to the GitHub Organization account defined in the `VUE_APP_GITHUB_ORG` variable.

For example, if you want to target the API calls to an organization, you would set `VUE_APP_SCOPE=organization` in the `.env` file.

````
VUE_APP_SCOPE=organization

VUE_APP_GITHUB_ORG= <YOUR-ORGANIZATION>

VUE_APP_GITHUB_ENT=
````


#### VUE_APP_MOCKED_DATA

To access Copilot metrics from the last 28 days via the API and display actual data, set the following boolean environment variable to `false`:

```
  VUE_APP_MOCKED_DATA=false
```

#### VUE_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN
Specifies the GitHub Personal Access Token utilized for API requests. Generate this token with the following scopes: _copilot_, _manage_billing:copilot_, _manage_billing:enterprise_, _read:enterprise_, _admin:org_.

```
  VUE_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN=
```
